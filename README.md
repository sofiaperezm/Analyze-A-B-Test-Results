# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
Data Analysis Project with the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. It includes probability calculations, hypothesis testing and regression models (multiple linear and logistic regression). I used Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries and the Random and StatsModels module.
